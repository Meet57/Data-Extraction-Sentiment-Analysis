# Data-Extraction-Sentiment-Analysis
Emotion Analysis of any text | Twitter data extraction and sentiment analysis based on COVID data

## Project Summary

In this application, we have dashboard where all the
information about our service will be given. Initially user gets 4 services which are:-
  1. Extract Tweets
  2. Sentiment Analysis based on COVID Model
  3. Use case of Google Perspective API
  4. Extract tweet with sentiment score
Main aim is to provide easy data mining as well as basic sentiment analysis using
different model as well as API.

## Conclusion

Nowadays, sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a hot topic in machine learning. We are
still far to detect the sentiments of corpus of texts very accurately because of the complexity
in the English language.
In this project we tried to show the basic way of classifying tweets into positive or negative
category using LSTM as baseline and how language models are related to the LSTM and
can produce better results. We could further improve our classifier by trying to extract more
features from the tweets, trying different kinds of features, tuning the parameters of the
LSTM, TextBlob, perspective API classifier, or trying another classifier all together.
As we know every coin have two sides, sentiment analysis is great but itâ€™s a difficult task.
The difficulty increases with increase in complexity of opinions expressed. In some of the
fields like product reviews, face recognition, span filter etc. are relatively easy whereas
fields like books, movies, art, music, indirect expressions of opinion are more difficult.
Sentiment analysis is in demand because of its efficiency. Thousands of text documents
can be processed for sentiment in seconds, compared to the hours by a team of people to
manually complete it. It is so efficient, accurate and fast that many businesses are adopting
text and sentiment analysis and incorporating it into their business processes.
